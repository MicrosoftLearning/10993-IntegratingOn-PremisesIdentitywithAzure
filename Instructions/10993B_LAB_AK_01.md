# Lab Answer Key:  Module 1: Introducing Azure AD
# Lab: Creating and managing an Azure AD tenant
  
## Exercise 1: Activating Azure AD and Office 365 trial subscriptions
  
#### Task 1: Create a new Microsoft account
  
>  **Note:** We recommend that you have an active Microsoft account without an Azure subscription assigned to it. If you do not want to use your private Microsoft account, if you do not have one, or if you already have an Azure subscription, please follow the steps in this task to create a new Microsoft account.

1.  Sign in to  **LON-CL1** as **LON-CL1\\Admin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**. If the  **Networks** pane appears, click **Yes**.
2.  From the taskbar, click the  **Microsoft Edge** icon.
3.  In the Microsoft Edge address bar, type  **www.live.com**, and then press Enter.
4.  Click the  **Create** **free account** link.
5.  On the  **Create account** page, enter a new email address in the Outlook.com domain, and then click **Next**.

  >  **Note:** Make sure that you write down the user name that you chose. For example, you can choose a user name in the _YourInitials-Date_\@outlook.com format, such as 
  > DJ-060815@outlook.com.

6.  Choose the password that you want to use with your new Microsoft account. Click  **Next**. 

  >  **Note:** Only for the purpose of this course, to avoid confusion, we recommend that you note or remember this password and use this same password for all cloud accounts that you create in the labs of this course. This password will be referred as _your password_ in all later tasks. All on-premises accounts from local AD DS, as well as the accounts that you synchronize from AD DS to Azure AD, will still use default password Pa55w.rd.

7.  On the  **Create account** page, fill in your first and last name, and then click **Next**. Choose your country/region, select your birth date, and then click  **Next**.
8.  On the  **Create account** **page, type** **the** **CAPTCHA** **text,** and then click **Next**.
9.  In the welcome window, click the right arrow several times until you see the "you're all set" message, and then click  **Let's go**.
10.  Verify that your inbox opens.


#### Task 2: Activate an Office 365 trial subscription

5.  Click  **Next**.
6.  On the  **Create your user ID** page, type the user name of your choice in the **User name** box, and then type **_Adatumyyxxxxx_** in the **Yourcompany** box (for example, Adatum12332).

  >  **Note:** If the name you choose for the company is not free, try a different name. Be sure to note this name, as you will be using it in later labs.

7.  Type  _your password_ in the **New password** and **Confirm password** text boxes.

  >  **Note:** For the purpose of this course, we recommend that you choose the same password as for your Microsoft account created in Task1. This approach should not be used in a production environment.

8.  Click  **Create my account**.
9.  On the  **Prove. You're. Not. A. Robot.** page, type your mobile phone number, and then click **Text me**.

  >  **Note:** If you do not have a mobile phone with you, ask your instructor for help.

This account will be your Global Administrator account for your Office 365 tenant and your Azure AD tenant.

12.  Ensure that the Microsoft 365 admin center opens with Office 365 setup. Click  **Exit and continue later**.
13.  Close the Microsoft Edge browser window.
